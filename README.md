# EVE-minimizer is a resource-saving tool

Its primary purpose is to fully-utilize EVE Online's "throttling" mechanics by putting inactive windows out of focus and minimizing them. Without minimizing windows, even if they're out of focus, they still use resources.

# Dependencies

EVE-minimizer requires `kdotool` which needs to be compiled. Install it here: https://github.com/jinliu/kdotool
